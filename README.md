--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Premise:**

In Carnom, reality itself teeters on madness as the approach of a cosmic event—the Veilfracture—unravels the barriers between worlds. Nightmarish hallucinations seep into waking life, twisting familiar landscapes into grotesque parodies of themselves. Villagers whisper to unseen entities, cultists dance in hypnotic spirals of blood, and shadows bleed into physical form. Time and sanity erode as the lunar sky fractures into kaleidoscopic chaos, signaling the inevitable awakening of eldritch horrors slumbering beneath reality. You, haunted by visions of past atrocities and driven to near madness, must navigate this psychedelic nightmare, mastering your skills to either halt or succumb to this terrifying convergence.
